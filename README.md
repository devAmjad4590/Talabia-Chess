## **For Windows, Mac and Linux:**

### **Navigate to the correct directory:** Ensure that you are in the correct directory where your Java files are located. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.

1. **Compile the Java files:** Open the Command Prompt (CMD) and compile all the Java files in the directory by typing the following command and pressing `Enter`:

    ```
    javac *.java
    ```

    - This command compiles all Java files (`*.java`) in the current directory. If the compilation is successful, it will create bytecode files with the `.class` extension for each Java file.
